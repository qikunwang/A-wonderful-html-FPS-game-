A wonderful html FPS game by qikun
A wonderful html FPS game is a project by developer qikunwang that serves as a technical showcase for building a first-person shooter (FPS) entirely within a web browser . Instead of relying on a pre-built game engine, the project leverages HTML5, JavaScript, and the popular Three.js library for rendering graphics 
This is a proof-of-concept for what can be achieved with modern web development tools and demonstrates creative solutions to technical challenges inherent in browser-based game development  The project showcases fundamental FPS mechanics.


                                                     ✔ Key features:
                                                     
                                ○  Built for the browser: The game is a lightweight, browser-
                                    based experience that requires no special downloads or installations .
     
                                ○  WebGL via Three.js: The project uses the Three.js library to tap into WebGL, 
                                    allowing for powerful 3D graphics rendering directly on the web .
     
                                ○  Varied environments: The project includes multiple distinct areas, such as a castle,
                                     an underground lava chamber, and a sci-fi complex, to highlight different
                                     technical capabilities and test rendering limits.
